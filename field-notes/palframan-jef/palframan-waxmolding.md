  * Foundry: 


##Oct 14 - Making the Mold Casting ###

* Conditions:
  * Lab conditions, approx. 72°, no air movement, average humidity.
* Materials:
  * Sand from Old Molds: The sand that was used was made from old molds supplied by Dr. Beentjes and Dr. Smith. The original molds varied in density from very corse and hard to fine and soft. After the molds were ground in a mortar with a pestle, they were sifted with a stainless steel sifter, that, as will be illustrated above, proved to be not sifted finely enough.
  * Sal ammoniac water: A mixture of sal ammoniac and water as specified in the recipe.
  * Brandy: Cheap brandy from the liquor store. [Get the brand name].
  * Wooden flask: Pre-made wooden flask to hold sand and mold.
  * Molding Clay: Commercially available. I
  * Plaster of Paris: <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Commercially available.</span>
* Equipment:
  * Mallet and Expresso Pounder: Weight mallet and Expresso pounder
  * Mixing Bowl:
  * Counter-Top:
  * Large Cutting-Knife:
  * Wax Carving Tools:
* Primary Recipe:
  * 118v - Casting in a box mold

### Discussion on Procedure (10 Oct 14)###
  * After some last minute detailing, the wax was pressed, face down, into the molding clay and removed shortly there after. During removal of the wax from the clay, in perpetration for plaster pouring, pieces of the wax mold broke off, partially due to improper molding of the wax portions to the medallions base and due to the thinness of the medallion itself.
  * The molded clay was then filled with plaster of paris and left overnight to dry over the weekend.

### Discussion on Procedure (14 Oct 14)###

  * At approximately 0900 the plaster mold was removed from the clay. The mold itself required additional work to bring out the detail as some of the features were distorted by the pressing of the wax into the clay and the warping of the clay itself as the wax was removed.
  * The most labor intensive part of the casting then began: the mixing of the sand. 3 and ½ cups of reclaimed sand from old molds were sifted and added to a mixing bowl. The recipe call for a mixture of sal ammoniac ("the size of two walnuts") and water ("the size of a bottle in which one boils ground barley"). Based upon feedback from other groups who were working around us, 1 ½ cups of this sal ammoniac water were added along with two silver spoonfuls of brandy.
  * Emily and I commenced blending together the ingredients. Mixing for about 10 mins produced a clumpy and dry mixture. We added another ⅔ of a cup of sal ammoniac water kept on mixing. The mixture became noticeably darker with the addition of more water.
  * We then added another ½ cup of sal ammoniac water and Emily noticed that the mixture was getting harder to mix. This may have been due to the binding of the sand or fatigue.
  * I (Jef) took over mixing that tried to use the spoon to press larger clumps of the sand against the side of the bowl.
  * Tony informed us that the mixture looked too wet so we started to add more sand in order to get the dryness back. We added ½ cup of sand and continued to mix.

  * The spoon quickly became tedious was discarded for mixing with my hands. Fingers are more efficient tools for breaking up the clumps that formed in the dirt. Eventually the mixture was judged to be dry enough to be placed in the box mold.

  * We dusted the face of the medallion with ground vine charcoal and placed it float on the counter in the center of the female portion of the flask and filled it slowly with sand. The back of the plaster medallion was not completely flush with the surface of the counter and this gave me cause for concern. I knew that the mold had broken in the clay earlier and I was worried this would happen again. When we filled the mold with sand the we had to press it firmly on to the medallion, but we tried to take care that this was not enough to break the plaster mold.

  * We packed the mold with sand and used the mallet and the espresso pounder to even it out. The excess was removed with a knife and an improvised leveling tool (pictured below in the bottom third of the photo) and returned to the mixing bowl. During the process of pounding and scraping, a relatively large amount of water was emerging from the sand. We believe that this is due to water that was trapped in the sand succumbing to the pounding.

  * We were again advised by Tony that the mixture was too wet and we added more dry sand to the outside of the mold to draw out the moisture.

  * Once this was completed the mold was lifted from the counter with a twisting motion in the hopes of cleanly releasing the medallion and the sand. This proved to be successful. At Tony's direction, small amount of the sand around the edge of the medallion was removed to aid in removing the plaster cast of the medallion later. The sand surrounding the medallion was then dusted with another thin layer of ground charcoal.

  * The male portion of the flask was set in place and the remainder of the mold was filled with sand. When the mold was almost full we found that we did not have enough sand. More sand was mixed, in haste, as the lab had to close in a short amount of time. The takeaway is that estimating the amount of sand required to fill the molds is deceptive. It is better to over estimate how much sand you need. A small mold can hold a lot of sand, even though it looks like it cannot. The mold was pounded and shaved and placed in the vapor hood to allow it to dry.

## Discussion on Procedure (14 Oct 14) ##

* At approximately 1030, I arrived at the lab and found that my medallion had already been removed from its mold. I unfortunetly was not there to record the procedure, but I was informed that it had broken upon removal.

* I could not tell if the image was distorted. The granular nature of the sand and its texture really obscured the image from the eye. I thought about what Dr. Smith had told us about her past experiences with molding, that being that molds often do not look like they have held the detail but turn out that they have. I hoped that this was true in our case. After inspecting the mold they were packed in boxes to be carried to the workshop the next day. 

* When I went to make the mold for Emily's medallion, I discovered that we were out of sand. Under Tony's instruction I utilized modern commercial sand. The intention of this was to provide a type of control for the other experiments and provide some contrast as to how sand can and does behave. 

* Working with the commercial sand was simple and direct. It was firm when packed and malleable when lose. The oil in the sand left very little residue on hands and tools, yet held the sand together enough that it could be packed. It took the impression of the medallion almost flawlessly, and released the plaster casting very easily. The sand was finely ground, way more finely ground than our EM sand. 

* The time it took to make the mold was significantly less as well. The mold was packed in the same manner are the medallion above and ground vine charcoal was used as a separation agent.
